This program runs a game of tic tac toe between two clients 
to run, the server must be activated first, and then the 
clients in any order, this program was written natively in my at
home fedora enviorment, so it doesnt have any dependencies 

to compile: 

make client server 

The server has some issues with being hung up in a draw situation 
i didnt have the time to be able to adress this, so if both clients 
quit and you notice the server still running, it must be manually exited 
with 

ctrl z
