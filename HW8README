This program acts as a chat room, with a client and a server 

The server holds the chatroom, and the clients connect

The defualt configuration is for no more than 4 clients, but the number can be edited in the top of 
the server program. 

To compile: 

make client server 



to run: 

run server first, then client to connect 

After initial "welcome to server message" you can type out any message and the username you choose 
will be added to your message and sent to all other clients 

to quit, type "quit" as your message, the server can be exited using the standard ctrl-z
